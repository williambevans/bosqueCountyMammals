    <h3>Eastern Red Bat</h3>

    <a title="want to know more?">
        <h6>Lasiurus Borealis</h6>
    </a>
    <p>Red bats are migratory bats that are common across Texas. They are most common in the eastern and central parts
        of the state, due to their requirement of forests for foliage roosting. West Texas specimens are associated with
        forested areas (cottonwoods). Also common along the coastline. These bats are highly mobile, seasonally
        migratory, and practice a type of "wandering migration". Associations with specific habitat is difficult unless
        specific migratory stopover sites or wintering grounds are found. Likely associated with any forested area in
        East, Central, and North Texas but can occur statewide.</p>
